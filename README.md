# ROADMAP  

## TEXTBOOK 
 Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, we recommend that students refer to the eBook, [Computer Programming with MATLAB by Fitzpatrick and Ledeczi](Resources/COMPUTER_PROGRAMMING_with_MATLAB.pdf), which was written specifically for this course. In addition to covering the material of this course in depth, it also includes additional sections on more advanced concepts, such as Object Oriented Programming and Graphical User Interfaces. The Apple iBooks version of this book is designed for iPads, iPhones, and MacBooks (OS X Mavericks and above) and is available in 51 countries from the iTunes Bookstore. The price is $10. For readers who prefer Windows, Android, or other platforms, and for readers in countries in which Apples textbooks are not sold, a PDF version is available at http://cs103.net/buy/ for the same price.  

## How to Get MAtlab?  
As a result of support from MathWorks, a license to MATLAB Online for the duration of the course is available. MATLAB Online gives you access to MATLAB directly from your browser on a computer with internet access. To get started using MATLAB Online:  

1. If you do not already have a MathWorks account, create one here: https://www.mathworks.com/mwaccount/register. Be sure to verify your email (check your Junk/Spam folders) before moving on to step 2.  

2. Set up your MathWorks account with MATLAB Online access by signing in using the course license: https://www.mathworks.com/licensecenter/classroom/intro_programming_ml/  

3. After using the link in step 2 to login in MATLAB Online for the first time, bookmark https://matlab.mathworks.com to use MATLAB Online during the course.  

MATLAB Online is supported in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari  


## The Matlab Online Desktop  
The document below serves as a companion to the video lecture entitled "The MATLAB Desktop", which introduces the programming environments of both MATLAB Online and installed MATLAB. It focuses on MATLAB Online and highlights differences from the installed version. It also introduces the MATLAB Drive Connector, which allows you to synchronize your MATLAB-Online files with those on your computer.  

This document will be updated and corrected as the course progresses. To determine when the latest changes were made to this file, note the revision date inside the document itself.

#### [Lesson 1 : Introduction to MATLAB](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/_ae74d38a0af3b8bc6e11fa1658159225_Lesson-1.pdf?Expires=1600560000&Signature=d7O5PggFXKXf1mdjXpabiK0FpaNzekeXhk~lkWKFiGJkqcrALskhXX7UhH8NSAVvhrqP7Kwvxs0aWoI2FzCghxW-BJSEVqSvcQnY7-GaNBX8T5rdzAE27qgFFzA1R-MzifTFwYO-MYTq36NcmLDaaF7ynC1wn8~4lZZ67vS8YVw_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A) 
We will learn how to start MATLAB and will familiarize ourselves with its user interface. We will learn how to use MATLAB as a sophisticated calculator. We will learn about syntax and semantics. We will see ways in which MATLAB provides help. Finally, we will learn how to create plots in MATLAB.  

#### [Lesson 2 : Matrices and Operators](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/_b04ec88b7f78855cebdcb88dcae39bf4_Lesson-2.pdf?Expires=1600560000&Signature=N1ubHrYq5UK22Mk6dN-gCjd8OtkLzHFXJWJK27MhJFZnIcI6oSE--M6KGSMDnHjFiyDwId0YXyQo~8S83k7uCQtksROzXs3clkYHKaxKsVjZRhL0Ea6OxSEV~Ee-Mb4kSsZulh-r6RKhxkIsSFKk~GCQx8kw92bQK9NH6FJWgb4_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A)  
The basic unit with which we work in MATLAB is the matrix. We solve problems by manipulating matrices, and operators are the primary means by which we manipulate them. We will learn how to define matrices, extract parts of them and combine them to form new matrices. We will learn how to use operators to add, subtract, multiply, and divide matrices, and we will learn that there are several different types of multiplication and division. Finally, we will learn MATLABâ€™s rules for determining the order in which operators are carried out when more than one of them appear in the same expression.
