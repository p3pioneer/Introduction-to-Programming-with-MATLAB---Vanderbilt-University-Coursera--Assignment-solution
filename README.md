# ROADMAP  

## TEXTBOOK 
 Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, we recommend that students refer to the eBook, [Computer Programming with MATLAB by Fitzpatrick and Ledeczi](Resources/COMPUTER_PROGRAMMING_with_MATLAB.pdf), which was written specifically for this course. In addition to covering the material of this course in depth, it also includes additional sections on more advanced concepts, such as Object Oriented Programming and Graphical User Interfaces. The Apple iBooks version of this book is designed for iPads, iPhones, and MacBooks (OS X Mavericks and above) and is available in 51 countries from the iTunes Bookstore. The price is $10. For readers who prefer Windows, Android, or other platforms, and for readers in countries in which Apples textbooks are not sold, a PDF version is available at http://cs103.net/buy/ for the same price.  

## How to Get Matlab?  
As a result of support from MathWorks, a license to MATLAB Online for the duration of the course is available. MATLAB Online gives you access to MATLAB directly from your browser on a computer with internet access. To get started using MATLAB Online:  

1. If you do not already have a MathWorks account, create one here: https://www.mathworks.com/mwaccount/register. Be sure to verify your email (check your Junk/Spam folders) before moving on to step 2.  

2. Set up your MathWorks account with MATLAB Online access by signing in using the course license: https://www.mathworks.com/licensecenter/classroom/intro_programming_ml/  

3. After using the link in step 2 to login in MATLAB Online for the first time, bookmark https://matlab.mathworks.com to use MATLAB Online during the course.  

MATLAB Online is supported in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari  


## The Matlab Online Desktop  
The document below serves as a companion to the video lecture entitled "The MATLAB Desktop", which introduces the programming environments of both MATLAB Online and installed MATLAB. It focuses on MATLAB Online and highlights differences from the installed version. It also introduces the MATLAB Drive Connector, which allows you to synchronize your MATLAB-Online files with those on your computer.  

This document will be updated and corrected as the course progresses. To determine when the latest changes were made to this file, note the revision date inside the document itself.

We will learn how to start MATLAB and will familiarize ourselves with its user interface. We will learn how to use MATLAB as a sophisticated calculator. We will learn about syntax and semantics. We will see ways in which MATLAB provides help. Finally, we will learn how to create plots in MATLAB.  

#### [Lesson 2 : Matrices and Operators](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/_b04ec88b7f78855cebdcb88dcae39bf4_Lesson-2.pdf?Expires=1600560000&Signature=N1ubHrYq5UK22Mk6dN-gCjd8OtkLzHFXJWJK27MhJFZnIcI6oSE--M6KGSMDnHjFiyDwId0YXyQo~8S83k7uCQtksROzXs3clkYHKaxKsVjZRhL0Ea6OxSEV~Ee-Mb4kSsZulh-r6RKhxkIsSFKk~GCQx8kw92bQK9NH6FJWgb4_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A)  
The basic unit with which we work in MATLAB is the matrix. We solve problems by manipulating matrices, and operators are the primary means by which we manipulate them. We will learn how to define matrices, extract parts of them and combine them to form new matrices. We will learn how to use operators to add, subtract, multiply, and divide matrices, and we will learn that there are several different types of multiplication and division. Finally, we will learn MATLAB’s rules for determining the order in which operators are carried out when more than one of them appear in the same expression.

#### [Lesson 3 : Functions](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/_8fed662f50428a0b9efa89236eeb0974_Lesson-3.pdf?Expires=1600560000&Signature=MTaVR2W5i9bbKyP5IwzrFAcCBc~IZsrrBozW7o3p0-JuxZxvJa7A1HOvxo3XqTNUbljtvDvDEYqhuIYPkDWMxp~pf0oZwc1FHYNyef--GMPEX5QKy~q6g~qRArTwdWt3HU57tQ2yunmMKeNbPpXrMmLoWooHvGrIk5fyjzq7MMg_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A)  
Functions let us break up complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. We will learn how functions let us create reusable software components that can be applied in many different programs. We will learn how the environment inside a function is separated from the outside via a well defined interface through which it communicates with the outside world . We will learn how to define a function to allow input to it when it initiates its execution and output from it when it is done.    

#### [Lesson 4 : Programmer's Toolbox](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/_50a433674d67da508ae4ea1cf86c598b_Lesson-4.pdf?Expires=1600560000&Signature=Bwde-3nD2fqqPuXzq5znPpva7rJYVVQr1XGW9Vl0~PtYTzNk~Ced8LxtA5hb~qKmaSbOttRiN5zPJJbTpeuuTrZjwv1RbRvrQW3DObB6dmlPWXkUvAenpwdeAk0yrGYc7RqvG5eewyOh~96BbQrxrxkpx5jUbKrV4VW95P-vN9s_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A)
MATLAB has useful built-in functions, and we will explore many of them in this section. We will learn about polymorphism and how MATLAB exploits it to change a function's behavior on the basis of the number and type of its inputs. Because random numbers play an important role in computer programming, we will learn how to use the MATLAB random number generator. We will learn how to get input from the keyboard, how to print to the Command Window, and how to plot graphs in a Figure window. Finally, we will learn how to find programming errors with the help of the debugger.

#### [Lesson 5 : Selection](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/_9a8e0a2d1133071639d3763a6c0f6b86_Lesson-5.pdf?Expires=1600560000&Signature=IRYwwXs3dillZAtyDyh69yxEnSOS1PQ-oZkBQK1XKO4344k33PF7Jxsoa9TV6SdIFKYuhHqEEmbB-2jObQx~3AI0NQh25YkNHVVOjQl35~QceZLRZkvgMNELGM-4hftB0i34cY31v-odYq2A2epzkmfQo~iTNYP9Z-xwyzwS-x8_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A)  
Selection is the means by which MATLAB makes decisions about the order in which it executes its statements. We will learn how to use the if-statement, which is the most important method of selection. We will learn how to use relational operators and logical operators. We will learn how to write polymorphic functions and how to make functions resistant to error.  

#### [Lesson 6 : Loops](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/_f032402efbabca732d1731b3e749dafb_Lesson-6.pdf?Expires=1600560000&Signature=FgbfihtaD1RfJ47ZxT5Jk5x1yaNP-htpQJLiI6LsJ0ip7R3xSymi6iGuFgclFjGZkjgQmhFTDd2CDSH7Y-iHTwgp07qJIOy8nTyM8PU9nXzYwsu71ugsDDqLbgWFAQnRpGR2v8ULFf6PGZzcM~bfNca1MKeOJxw6qscp6xOou7I_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A)   
Loops give computers their power. We will learn how to use the for-loop and the while- loop. We will learn how the break-statement works, and we will use nested loops. We will learn how to make loops more efficient. We will learn about logical indexing and see how to use it to produce implicit loops that are efficient and easy to read.  

#### [Lesson 7 : Data Types](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/_f118f5f56f34baa636c30319643e70cb_Lesson-7.pdf?Expires=1600560000&Signature=M57JcS6TDrfYYaYFXjJ6DQTck~WXsJuflsS6Px4iR7oyD4BbHq68dAxyaqlSkWuPFwTZgtATF5-p5RZUQdBPAi2U3pccJzc5V1gzGnHzRUwoSsSCJW13FsFyn1hfHYZiGhYuujURIjRlCuqGHYg-mKshJBCglC90uyhthZg52FI_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A)  
Computers operate on bits, but humans think in terms of numbers, words, and other types of data. Like any good language, MATLAB organizes bits into convenient data types. We will study those types in this section. We will learn that there are ten types of numbers and that there are conversion functions to change one type into another. We will learn much more about strings and how the characters in them are encoded as numbers. We will learn how to produce heterogeneous collections of data via data types called structs and cells, and we will learn how to store both points in time and time durations.  

#### [Lesson 8 : File I/O](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/_ae2b0ed744e6f5c52100295e59550ac6_Lesson-8.pdf?Expires=1600560000&Signature=QJBKT55nC8M7NN0UKEzbMm~5Ojj39Yk~qFKzZ3F4O9YaG2Vc1JyMiHfaYukrwSSCUQpSLBxacIkEwFsDgtOACkf9a15Bxv~U0-g4w~CsfEuwLUBKqX0GAF4LQPaXavoYfmoR7QzFviisYXW7UiXbOS1jL4iCUFbp1QNy4D~Yujc_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A)  
Files are named areas in permanent memory for storing data that can be used as input or output to MATLAB and to other programs. We will be introduced to MATLAB’s most important methods for reading and writing files. We will learn how to create, read from, and write to MAT-files, Excel files, text files, and binary files. We will learn how to navigate among folders with MATLAB commands.
