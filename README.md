# ROADMAP  

## TEXTBOOK 
 Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, we recommend that students refer to the eBook, Computer Programming with MATLAB by Fitzpatrick and Ledeczi, which was written specifically for this course. In addition to covering the material of this course in depth, it also includes additional sections on more advanced concepts, such as Object Oriented Programming and Graphical User Interfaces. The Apple iBooks version of this book is designed for iPads, iPhones, and MacBooks (OS X Mavericks and above) and is available in 51 countries from the iTunes Bookstore. The price is $10. For readers who prefer Windows, Android, or other platforms, and for readers in countries in which Apples textbooks are not sold, a PDF version is available at http://cs103.net/buy/ for the same price.
